## Instructions

Use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view) for self-checking your submission.

Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like `Player` and `Enemy`) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`. Also make sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

Your **README.md** file should be updated with instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

## How to observe Output

For observing the `output` initially after extracting the project and after making changes in files open the **index.html** file in the working directory.

## Steps done

  **_ I have done the following steps for completing the project _**

-   Initially I have downloaded the `zip file` and unzipped it and opened the **index.html** file.

-   First, I have created the `player` object and gave the position to the player.I have displayed the player in that position written in Player `render` function.

-   Then, I ensured that player can move `left`, `right`, `top`, `down` and also made sure that player doesn't move beyond the boundaries of the canvas which is written in Player `handleInput` function.

-   I have created an array named `allEnemies` and pushed three enemy positions(stored in enemyLocation) into it .Also, I have given the speed for enemies and displayed those enemies which is written in Enemy `render` function.

-   I ensured that enemies moves straight along the `canvas` width completely and again starts from their initial position.

-   While playing the game, if the player collides with the enemy then the `sweetalert` window is displayed with messages like('You have lost the game, playAgain button') which is written in Enemy `update` function and player comes to initial position.

-   After the game is won by the player i.e, after he reaches the water then the `sweetalert` window is displayed with Congratulations message and playAgain button which is written in Player update function.

-   `playAgain` button makes sure that game is `restarted`.

## How to run the Game

To run the game, first open the index.html file to have the initial view of the game .You will get errors in the console initially. Then, rectify the errors in the game one by one. After rectifying each error observe the output by refreshing the insex.html page. Finally, after rectifying all errors, game runs successfully and then you can make necessary changes and run the game.

## How to play the Game

Press `arrow keys` to move the player up,down,left,right so that he cannot touch the enemies.
